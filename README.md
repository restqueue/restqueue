# restqueue

Welcome to RESTQueue the REST-based Messaging framework and server generation open-source project.

The idea behind this project is to make it much simpler and easier to create and use messaging based systems that can work 
with messaging senders and consumers written in almost any programming language.

RESTQueue is a open source framework that helps you to quickly create a feature-rich, REST-based messaging server to support 
your messaging application or system. The framework uses the principal of convention over configuration so that you can set 
up a number of messaging channels incredibly quickly but also configure them to your exact requirements. It features REST APIs 
for the message channels (so that using it with non-Java systems is simple) but it is also supported by Java libraries to make 
working with your messages very easy.

A simple example of how RESTQueue can be used is for a situation when you have a number of people (or software components) 
that allocate themselves tasks from a queue, process these tasks and then remove the tasks from the queue when complete.

Take a look at the Wiki to get started and download the Java jars from the downloads folder under the Source link above.
